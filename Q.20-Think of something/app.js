// Q.20 Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var languages = ["urdu", "english", "arabic", "french", "hindi"];
console.log("list of languages: ");
for (var _i = 0, languages_1 = languages; _i < languages_1.length; _i++) {
    var top_1 = languages_1[_i];
    console.log(top_1);
}
