// Q.14 Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guestList = ["Umer", "Abeera", "Rayyan"];
for (var i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
    console.log("Respected Sir/Maam, " +
        guestList[i] +
        "\nI would like to invite you for lavish dinner today.\nThank You,");
}
